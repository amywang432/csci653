# Summary report for CSCI653 - Real-time data stream processing
## Name: Yimin Wang

# Goal
Nowadays the topic of Big Data is trending dramatically since large amount of data is generated every day, even every second in various companies. Among all the industrial problems related to Big Data, how to process real-time big-data stream  is a difficult however important one to be solved. Streaming data is continuously generated by different sources and needs to be processed incrementally by the tecniques of stream processing.

For example, an ecommerce retailer may collect large amount of data generated by customers' shopping and surfing activities. When one customer is surfing on the website and hesitating to purchase something. If the real-time engine can collect data of his activity data and also other users' data in the same region or with similar shopping habit and push the fresh data to the recommendation system, it could make analysis and give correctly incentiving recommendations or compelling offers to the customers who are surfing online based on their current activities and shopping history and profile and finally customers will probably finalize their purchase.[1] Also, airline traffic control system requires to process large amounts of real-time data timely. Otherwise, serious accidents may occur due to long delay of processing data.[2] Based on the two industrial examples, we can see that achieving real-time data stream processing can make profits and avoid accidents.

# Specific objectives

# Process
![](process.png)
To meet all requirements about big data processing, many useful and powerful big data softwares and tools are devevloped and open-sourced by famous companies so that we can use them to meet most basic requirements. Currently, Apache Hadoop is still a powerful tool to maintain a highly distributed file system (HDFS) with Yarn to control resource management and job scheduling. Many other open-source software are built on top of Hadoop. For exmaple, Apache Spark is a cluster-computing framework which is compatible with Hadoop data through Yarn and it dramatically improves the performance of Map-Reduce. Also, Spark Streaming is a powerful tool to process data streaming.

# Current state of the knowledge/previous work
# Techniques to be used

# Expected results
With so many powerful open-source big data tools, framework and software available, I plan to do website activiy log processing system using Hadoop, Spark, Kafka and so on so that the system can finish off-line query and process data streaming efficienty. That is my initial plan for my CSCI 653 project. I may add more contents with the development of this project.


## Flume, Kafka and Spark Streaming
Apache Flume: A distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of log data. It has a simple and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows. It is robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms and many failover and recovery mechanisms. It uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online analytic application.[1]

Apache Kafka: Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system.[2]

Spark Streaming: an extension of the core Spark API that enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Kinesis, or TCP sockets, and can be processed using complex algorithms expressed with high-level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dashboards. In fact, you can apply Spark’s machine learning and graph processing algorithms on data streams.[3]
