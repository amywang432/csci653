Introduction to CSCI 653 project
This is my initial idea about how to develop my CSCI 653 project. Some changes may be made with the development of this project in this semester.

Nowadays Big Data is a very hot topic. Many companies collect large amount of data from different sources. It becomes more and more difficult and important to store and maintain large data-sets in a highly distributed system with high availability and accomplish a fast query on the large data set as required for data analysis.

To meet all requirements about big data processing, many useful and powerful big data softwares and tools are devevloped and open-sourced by famous companies so that we can use them to meet basic requirements for big data. Currently, Apache Hadoop is still a powerful tool to maintain a highly distributed file system (HDFS) with Yarn to control resource management and job scheduling. Many other open-source software are built on top of Hadoop. For exmaple, Apache Hive is a data warehouse providing SQL-like interface for querying data stored in Hadoop; Apache Spark is a cluster-computing framework which is compatible with Hadoop data through Yarn and it dramatically improves the performance of Map-Reduce. 

With so many powerful open-source big data tools, framework and software available, I plan to do website activiy log processing system using Hadoop, Hive, Spark and so on. If possible, I also want to develop a project using Spark Streaming to process streaming data to implement read-data processing. That is my initial plan for my CSCI 653 project. I may add more contents with the development of this project.
